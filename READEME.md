# Statistical Study of Encodings

This repository contains a project that performs a statistical study of different encoding schemes used in digital communication. The project includes MATLAB code to generate, encode, and analyze bit streams using various encoding techniques.

## Projects Structure

- `01_Statistical_Study_Of_Encodings/`
  - `code/`
    - `project1.m`: MATLAB script to generate and analyze encoded bit streams.
    ## Outputs

    1. **Statistical Mean:**
        1. **Statistical Mean:**
            - Calculate the average value of the encoded bit stream.

    2. **Stationarity:**
        - Check if statistical properties are time-invariant.

    3. **Ensemble Autocorrelation Function:**
        - Average product of signal with its time-shifted version.

    4. **Time Mean and Autocorrelation:**
        - Average signal over time and compute autocorrelation for one waveform.

    5. **Ergodicity:**
        - Compare time averages with ensemble averages.

    6. **Bandwidth:**
        - Analyze frequency spectrum to determine signal's bandwidth.

## How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open MATLAB and navigate to the `code` directory.
3. Run the `project1.m` script to generate and analyze the encoded bit streams.
4. The results will be displayed in the MATLAB command window and as plots.
